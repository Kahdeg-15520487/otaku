"""The machine's memory, from the platform's own numbers.

The model picker's header carries a RAM gauge — loading a model is the
one thing otaku does that can fill a machine up — and that is the whole
need: `virtual_memory()` answers `(used, total)` in bytes, or None where
the platform will not say, so the caller hides the line instead of
printing a guess. No dependency for it: the total comes from sysconf,
and what is used from `/proc/meminfo` on Linux and a `vm_stat` parse on
macOS. Windows has neither, so the gauge simply does not appear — the
same degrade-to-silence posture the terminal queries in `tty` take.

USED means what a model loading right now could not have without the
machine going to work for it first. Both platforms are asked that one
question, each in its own vocabulary:

- Linux answers it directly. `MemAvailable` is the kernel's own estimate
  of what a new process could take — free memory plus the page cache it
  would drop for it, less the reserve the kernel keeps back — so used is
  everything else.
- macOS keeps no such number, so used is composed the way Activity
  Monitor composes it: the anonymous pages minus the discardable
  (purgeable) ones, plus the wired and the compressed. Cold anonymous
  memory counts as USED even though the kernel could reclaim it, because
  reclaiming it means compressing or swapping it first — counting the
  whole inactive list as free reads gigabytes rosier than every other
  tool on the machine.

The answer is cached for a couple of seconds: the picker repaints on
every keystroke and every spinner frame, `vm_stat` is a subprocess, and
RAM does not move that fast.
