"""The colors otaku prints, in the shade the terminal's background asks
for: one Theme per background, `use` settling it once at launch (the ask
reads stdin, so it must precede prompt_toolkit), `theme()` returning the
one in force. A surface names the role it needs; no module picks a
light/dark pair of its own.

A slot is a `Color`, resolved when the theme is built: the escape a
terminal wants and the name prompt_toolkit wants are the SAME decision,
and a caller should not have to make it again to paint with it.

Two kinds of spec go in, and the difference is deliberate:

- A **name** ("blue") compiles to one of the 16 palette slots, which the
  reader's own terminal theme shades. No shipped slot is one: otaku's
  colors are its own, the same in every terminal. It is what a reader
  spells in `dialogue_color` when they would rather their scheme decided
  the color of speech than otaku did.
- A **#rrggbb** is exact everywhere. Used only where otaku must PAINT:
  the played block's band, the selected row's, and a dialog floating
  over a list it would otherwise show through. A slot the reader's theme
  could shade would make those unreadable against themselves.
- **"default"** hands the terminal back its own color, which is what
  makes a surface transparent. A picker is the terminal with a list on
  it, not a card laid over one.

Which theme is `[ui]`'s `theme`: "light" or "dark" is the reader saying
so and settles it, and "auto" asks the terminal. An unanswered
background reads as DARK — the ask cannot happen at all on Windows and
fails quietly enough elsewhere (a pipe, an ssh, a silent emulator) that
the fallback has to be the likelier terminal rather than the tidier
default.
