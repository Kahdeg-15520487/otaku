"""The story's typed language, and what each stored turn sends.

Two questions, one vocabulary. Reading: `read(line)` binds a typed line
to whatever opened it — a direction (/me, /you, /ooc) or prose when
nothing did — and `is_command` answers the other side of the same coin
(a slash word that is not story syntax belongs to the command table).
Writing: `to_wire` is the ONE dispatch turning a stored turn into wire
text, whatever its kind — prose parses for its syntax, a direction's
stored template fills, a card row takes the block composed from its
archive, a recap row IS its text.

A line is stored exactly as typed and read again whenever the turn is
used. Templates are data on the turn (`Message.template`); at RECORD
time the caller resolves `Line.template_field` against its prompts and
hands the text through `freeze_template`, where a direction bakes in
what must never re-compose — a dice roll's numbers are decided once,
when the turn records, and never again. This module reads no settings.

Why this lives in `context`, not `backend`: what a stored turn sends is
context composition — the assembler runs `to_wire` for every row it puts
on the wire, and the worker's extraction composes rows the same way
(`numbered_chat`); both sit BELOW backend and may not reach up. And
reading and writing are one vocabulary — the same Line classes that
parse a typed line define how its stored turn composes — so splitting
them across packages would put one language in two homes. `backend.commands`
re-exports `is_command` — the one piece of this module frontends may
call; the language itself lives at the lowest package everything that
speaks it can reach.

Vocabulary: syntax = this language; directions (/me /you /ooc) OPEN a
line, inliners (/ooc /cue) CLOSE one, told apart by position (an
inliner's slash must follow whitespace, which keeps `and/or` and URLs
prose); framing = a direction's template; command = a slash word that
acts, and none of this module's business. A typed line is deliberately
NOT called a prompt — that word is already spent three ways
(`settings.prompts.Prompts` the templates, `AssembledPrompt` the full
request, the input prompt the terminal draws), and the most overloaded
word must not name the most precise concept.
