"""Character cards as context material: the normalized `Card`, the
archive the cast row keeps, macro binding, and the wire block composed
back out of the archive — writer and reader of the archive in ONE
place. FILE decoding (PNG chunks, JSON) lives with the other wild
formats, in `backend.formats.cards`; this module never touches bytes.
`{{char}}`/`{{user}}` macros stay unbound until `bind` applies the names
only the import knows. Everything here is pure strings.
