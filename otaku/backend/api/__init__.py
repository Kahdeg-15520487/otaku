"""The operation surface — the functions the frontends call, one module
per area, each function taking the `Session` first: the web API's tags
made structural. One deliberate exception to the 1:1: the sketch's
`session` tag is served by `Session`'s own state plus this package's
`settings` knobs. Everything else in `backend` is substrate: the
session and its launch, the shared vocabulary, the command table, the
document formats."""
