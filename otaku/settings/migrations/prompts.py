"""prompts.toml's shape-change table's moves: refreshed templates.

The stub materializes EVERY template at first run, so a built-in change
reaches fresh installs only — an existing file pins the text it was
written with. `refresh_template` is the convergent move: replace a
template with the current built-in ONLY when the file still holds a
superseded shipped default, byte-exact as the stub wrote it — an edited
template never matches and is never touched, which is the right
precedence by definition. Each shipped change of a template adds its
superseded text here, frozen from the release tag (the DB steps'
convention); v0.2.0 through v0.2.2 shipped one identical text each.

You are a story analyst. Read the scene below — the latest exchange of an
interactive story — and extract its memory.

Known characters so far (use these exact names when referring to them):
{cast}

Character journals so far — their story to date; continue it, do not restart it:
{journals}

LANGUAGE: write every value you produce — the title, the summary, the entries,
the states — in the SAME LANGUAGE the scene below is written in. Do not
translate it, and do not answer in English because these instructions are in
English. Only the JSON keys stay in English.

Extract from THIS SCENE ONLY and reply with ONLY a JSON object, no prose, in this shape:
{
  "scene": {"title": "...",
             "summary": "a detailed narrative recap of the scene, 250-400 words"},
  "speakers": [{"n": 1, "speaker": "who speaks or acts in message [n], or null"}],
  "characters": [{"name": "...", "aliases": ["..."],
                   "description": "one line, or null"}],
  "journals": [{"character": "name",
                 "entry": "their own record of this scene",
                 "state": "their situation right now"}]
}

Rules:
- "summary": prose, chronological, written like a story recap — not a synopsis.
  This summary is the ONLY record the story keeps of this scene: once it scrolls
  out of the recent messages, nothing else about it reaches the model. Write it
  so someone who never read the scene could continue the story from it. Cover,
  in order: who is present and where; what each of them does and says that
  matters; every decision, promise, threat, or refusal, and who made it; what is
  revealed, and to whom; anything given, taken, shown, or hidden; how moods and
  relationships shift; and what is left unresolved. Quote a line verbatim when
  its exact wording matters.
- "speakers": for EVERY numbered message, the single character who speaks or acts
  in it (their exact name); null when it is narration, several characters, or out
  of character.
- "characters": only NEW characters first appearing in this scene.
- "journals": one for EVERY character who appears or acts in this scene.
  "entry" is that character's own record of THIS SCENE ONLY — what they did, saw,
  heard, and felt, in the order they experienced it. Up to ~250 words, in
  proportion to how much of the scene is theirs: a bystander gets a few lines,
  the character the scene turns on gets the full length. Write only what they
  witnessed or were told — a character does not know what happened while they
  were absent, and a secret kept from them is not in their entry. This entry is
  permanent and is never rewritten, so put everything of theirs into it now.
  "state" is a snapshot, not a history: 1-3 sentences — where they are, what they
  wear and carry, how they feel, what they want, right now.
- Lines marked ((OOC: …)) are the players talking out of character: never part of
  the scene's story, but decisions made there belong in the summary and journals.
- Every value stays in the scene's own language (see LANGUAGE above).
- Empty lists are fine. JSON only.
