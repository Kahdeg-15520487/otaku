"""Work handed to the thread that owns the session.

A sqlite connection answers only the thread that created it — the store
is built that way, and the background worker keeps its own connection for
the same reason — while an HTTP server answers on a thread per
connection. So a handler never touches the session: it hands work to the
thread that owns it and waits for the answer. Serialization comes free,
because there is only ever one thread in there.

The cost of one thread is that a long job holds it, and the longest job
in otaku is a reply arriving token by token. So reads are queued apart
and answered in the gaps between frames: browsing the stories, opening
the lore, previewing the context all work while the model is talking,
without a second connection and without two callers in the session at
once.

This is the one piece of the package a reader must understand
independently of HTTP, which is why it is not in the HTTP file.
