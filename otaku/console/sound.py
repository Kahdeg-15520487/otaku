"""Calling the user back to the screen — the platform's own player, and
the terminal's own bell.

`/set notification` decides WHETHER a landed reply rings; this is the
how, for both frontends: the chat rings the terminal it is drawn in,
and `otaku web` rings the terminal it was launched from — the same desk
either way, which is why the sound lives HERE, in what both print
through. No dependency for it: every platform can play a sound of its
own — the posix ones by spawning a player, Windows through `winsound` in
the standard library — and a machine that cannot still has `BELL`.
Windows is the one that plays in-process, so it has no player to look
for and reads WAV alone; a sound it cannot open rings the bell like any
other. The bell is the honest fallback rather than a lesser one: the
emulator is what turns it into a beep, a flash, or a desktop
notification, so the last word belongs to the terminal either way.

Which sound is `config.toml`'s `notification_sound`: "default" for the
platform's own task-finished sound, or a path. A path that is not there
to play rings the bell too — audible and wrong beats silent and wrong,
because silence reads as a broken feature rather than a bad setting.

Never waits: a sound is a second of audio the prompt has no reason to
sit through, so the player is spawned and let go.
