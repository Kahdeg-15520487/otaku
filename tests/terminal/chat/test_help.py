"""The /help layout: what the terminal's own rendering promises at any
width. Two columns when the split saves real height, one otherwise; a
description wraps inside its column rather than being cut; and whatever
the width, every command is still on the page.

The look is not asserted — running the app shows that. What running it
cannot show is the layout holding at widths nobody opens a terminal at,
and no command falling out of a column at one of them.
