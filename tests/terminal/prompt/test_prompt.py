"""The prompt's pure pieces: the shortcut carry and the multiline assembler.

`Carry` hands a shortcut's exit across the prompt boundary: `take_text`
consumes the restored draft (once), while `text` itself stays readable
for the erase of what was shown; `take_shortcut` is a one-shot flag.

`LineAssembler`'s contract is the `\"\"\"` convention: a line starting the
delimiter opens a block that collects lines until one ends with it, and
the text between them — newlines preserved — comes back as one message,
and comes back as one message. A plain line passes straight through,
stripped. A block is multiline entry and nothing more — what it collects
is an ordinary prompt, told apart from a typed line nowhere downstream.
The one difference is settled here: a block keeps the whitespace at its
edges, because someone who opened one to lay text out meant the layout.
