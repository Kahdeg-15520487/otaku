"""What may reach the terminal from the tail under `otaku web`.

The lines it draws are made from bytes off a socket — any page in any
browser can ask a loopback server for a path of escape sequences — so
nothing in one may be a sequence the terminal obeys. The tail rewrites
itself by moving the cursor, and a line that can move it too would
rewrite the address above it.

The rule lives inside `Ticker.show`, so that is what is driven here —
against a buffer that says it is a terminal. Nothing else of one is
involved: the rows are written into memory and read back as text.
