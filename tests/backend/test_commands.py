"""The shared command surface: what a spec tells the frontends about a
row, and how a typed line is read against the table.

`find` binds a typed line's head to its spec, the longest match winning
for the /set family; the inliner rows never match a line's start — they
close a line, they do not open one. `raw_argument` cuts the argument the
one way both frontends must cut it, and `unknown_notice` is the sentence
both show for a line no row answers. What a row's `args` shape means for a
MENU — whether accepting it leaves the line open — is the frontend's
rule, held beside the menu that acts on it.
