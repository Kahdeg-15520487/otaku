"""The database nucleus: connection + cipher, lifecycle, guards, backups.

`Database.open` owns opening: a fresh file gets the schema, its version,
and a sealed *check canary*; an existing one must present a canary the
session cipher opens — which catches a plaintext database opened with
encryption configured, an encrypted one opened without it, AND a wrong
or replaced key, all before any content is touched. A daily
`VACUUM INTO` snapshot lands in the backups dir on the first open of the
day. Administrative facts (a migration ran, a backup was written or
failed) are RETURNED in `Database.notes` for the caller to log — the
store writes no log itself.
