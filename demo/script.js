      "The voice does not come closer, and it does not need to: the culvert carries it to you the way a speaking-tube carries a captain, round and intimate and completely without direction.\n\n" +
      "“Late,” it says again, tasting the word. “Three nights I have been walking uphill with my whole life on my back, and the one person in the valley whose job it is to notice where rivers are drew me in the wrong place the entire time.”\n\n" +
      "Something shifts in the dark ahead — not a splash, exactly. The sound water would make clearing its throat.\n\n" +
      "“Well. You have ink on your hands and my old bed on your boots, mapmaker. Come in out of the sky and we will talk about where I am going — and about what you are going to do with that map of yours, which I notice has already started telling the truth without your permission.”",
    alt:
      "For a while the culvert only breathes at you — a slow push of cool air with the smell of deep stone in it, the way a well smells at noon.\n\n" +
      "“You brought the map,” the voice says at last. There is water in it, unmistakably: the shape of the words comes rounded at the edges, worn like the stones under your boots. “Good. Paper listens better than people. Yours has been listening for two days.”\n\n" +
      "A thin sheet of current curls around your ankle, unhurried, and lets go.\n\n" +
      "“Come inside, mapmaker. Mind the third step — I have not decided where it goes yet.”",

    text:
      "You have to stoop for the first few yards, one hand on the crown of the culvert, and then the dark opens out in a way the lock's builders never planned: the brick gives way to something older, dressed stone the size of cart beds, and the ceiling lifts until your held breath comes back to you late, like an echo with second thoughts.\n\n" +
      "The water is ankle-deep here and all of it is moving uphill.\n\n" +
      "“The weir,” the voice says, conversational, from everywhere. “Four hundred years I asked it to open. Ask a thing every day for four hundred years and the asking wears a channel — in you, not in the thing.” A pause, and the current tugs once at your boots, gently, the way Tallis tugged his rope. “So I stopped asking. Sit down on the dry ledge to your left, mapmaker. You cannot draw standing up, and I want you to draw.”",
    alt:
      "Inside, the culvert is not a culvert for long. Ten paces in, your boots find stairs — stairs, going down under a river that is going up — and the sound of the water reorganizes itself around you until it is less like a stream and more like a room full of quiet people who have just stopped talking.\n\n" +
      "“I will tell you what I told the weir,” the voice says. “I am done with the sea. Everything I carry ends up there, everything I am gets handed over at the mouth, and in four hundred years it has not once said thank you.”\n\n" +
      "The current noses at your ankle like a dog deciding about you.\n\n" +
      "“The map, please. I want to see where you think I have been.”",

      "You unroll the survey on the ledge, and the red line you drew at the ferry stirs like an eyelash. Where your lantern light falls on the paper, the water in the chamber grows very still — the particular stillness of someone reading over your shoulder.\n\n" +
      "“There,” the voice says, and a bead of water lands precisely on the weir at Harrow Lock, soaking a small circle of the paper dark. “That is where I turned. And here—” a second drop, higher, above the springline, in the blank hills where you have never had reason to draw anything, “—is where I am going. There is a valley up there with no river in it. There has never been a river in it. Think of that, mapmaker. A whole valley, waiting four hundred years with its bed made.”\n\n" +
      "The chamber breathes. The drops on your map do not dry.\n\n" +
      "“Draw me the way. Not the way I came — the way I finish. Draw it, and I will tell you what to do about the village I am leaving behind.”",
    alt:
      "You spread the map. For a long moment nothing happens — and then the wet climbs the paper's edge in a neat, deliberate line, one contour at a time, the way a careful reader keeps their place with a finger.\n\n" +
      "“Your survey is honest,” the voice says, grudging, as if honesty in paper were a trick it had not seen before. “Wrong now, but honestly wrong. I can work with that.”\n\n" +
      "Above the weir, in the empty hills, the paper darkens by itself: a thin wandering line, climbing.\n\n" +
      "“That is my road. I have been drawing it for three nights and nobody would look. You will look, mapmaker, and you will make it true in red — and then we will discuss what a valley owes its river, and what a river owes a ferryman who stayed.”",

    text:
      "“The village,” the voice says, before you can ask, “will want to know it was not their fault. It was not. Tell them that first — people can hear nothing until they have heard that.”\n\n" +
      "The water walks its slow way up the stairs beside you, riser by riser, patient as arithmetic.\n\n" +
      "“The wells will hold. The mill will not, and the miller knows it — he has been overdue for honesty with himself since before you were born. And Tallis—” the voice softens the way the current softened at your ankle, “—Tallis stays, whatever you tell him. He is the only one of them who ever talked TO me and not ABOUT me. So you will carry him a message, mapmaker, and you will carry it exactly: the crossing is not closed. It has moved. And it is uphill from here, and it will need a ferryman who is not afraid of a river that learned to climb.”",
    alt:
      "“Ask your questions,” the voice says. “You have been holding them so hard the chamber can taste the iron.”\n\n" +
      "And when you ask the only one that matters — why — the water goes quiet for the length of three slow breaths.\n\n" +
      "“Because the sea takes,” it says at last. “Every river ends by being swallowed and none of us ever asked what would happen if one of us said no. I said no. That is all the mystery there is, mapmaker. The rest is engineering.”\n\n" +
      "A drop lands on the back of your writing hand, cool and exact.\n\n" +
      "“Write THAT under your red line, where the next surveyor will find it.”",

  "The water considers what you said the way the older stones consider frost — slowly, and from every side at once. “Go on,” the voice says. “You are getting somewhere, even if it is not where you think.”",
  "Somewhere above you, faint through forty feet of hill, a bell rings in the village — noon, or an alarm, or both. The river laughs, a sound like a lock filling. “They will get used to me being gone. Valleys always think they are the river. The river knows better.”",
  "Your lantern gutters and steadies. In the moment of dark, you would swear the water had climbed three more steps — and in the light, it politely has not. “Careful,” says the voice, amused. “I am on my best behaviour while you are drawing.”",
  "“Tallis used to sing on the crossing,” the voice says, apropos of your pen scratching. “Badly. Every day for fifty years. You may tell him the river said so — he will know what I mean by it.”",
  "The red line on your map is longer than you have drawn it. You measure twice against your last bearing before you accept it: the map is keeping up with the river now, and it is doing it without you. “You see,” the voice says gently, “why I needed a mapmaker who could stand being corrected.”",
