"""/card — a character card imported into the story.

An import is three writes and no model call: the `/card` line as typed
(`kind='card'`, speaker-linked to the cast), the cast row carrying the
card TOML, and the greeting — the character's own words, an authored
assistant turn with the speaker set. The wire composes the block from
the archive at request time, so a `/lore` correction reaches the next
request; `/undo` takes the import's exchange whole. The extraction never
reads a card (a story holding only one extracts nothing, and a forced
pass summarizes around it). The fixtures are SillyTavern's own bundled
Seraphina (a real PNG card) and a minimal JSON one.
