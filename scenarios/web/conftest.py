"""The web frontend, served over a real session.

`page` is the browser's side of it: the same requests the page makes,
against `web.serve` over a session opened for it.

The session is opened ON the serving thread, because that is where the
app opens it — a sqlite connection answers only its own thread, and the
whole of `web.thread` exists to keep every touch of the session there. So the
test thread never holds the session: it holds `page`, and it reads the
store through its own connection (`harness.read_store`), the way every
other scenario asserts.
